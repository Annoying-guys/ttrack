Tracking Project

About:

This project is a monocular/stereo tracking system which detects and
localises 3D objects in video images. The system
incorporates a Random Forest classifier and a level-set based
segmentation system to determine pose in 3D dimenesions. The system is
currently being developed to tracking MIS instruments but can easily
be extended to track any rigid object.

Dependencies:

OpenCV v2.3.1 or higher 
Boost v1.48.0 but will probably work on other versions of boost too.

Install Guide:

Linux - Grab the makefile from the build directory and copy to the
root directory. Build with Make.   

Windows - Support not currently available. Will add a VS2010 solution shortly.

OS-X - Code does not support OS-X. No plans to add support in the future.
